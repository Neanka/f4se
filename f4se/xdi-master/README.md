[![Build status](https://ci.appveyor.com/api/projects/status/github/reg2k/xdi?branch=master&svg=true)](https://ci.appveyor.com/project/reg2k/xdi)

The Extended Dialogue Interface (XDI) is a community framework and engine modification for Fallout 4 that removes the hardcoded 4-option limit on dialogue and adds native support for any number of player dialogue options.

XDI enables mods to create new dialogue experiences that emphasize player choice and have dialogue options that truly reflect their intent.
